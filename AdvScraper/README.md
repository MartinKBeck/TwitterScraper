# How to Scrape More From Tweets on Twitter
This folder contains the jupyter notebooks for my advanced scraping tutorial published [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-scrape-tweets-from-twitter-59287e20f0f1 "written article").

This folder contains two subfolders based on two different Python packages I used to scrape tweets. Each sub-folder contains an article notebook that follows the code snippets in my article and a companion notebook that provides more code examples and easy to use functions. This folder also contains a third item titled Tweepy_and_GetOldTweets3.ipynb that utilizes both Python packages to allow one to use GetOldTweets3 and have access to user information. 

The contents of this folder and its subfolders are shown below.
