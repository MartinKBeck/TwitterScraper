# How to Scrape Tweets with snscrape
This folder contains the jupyter notebooks for my snscrape scraping tutorial published [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-scrape-tweets-with-snscrape-90124ed006af).

This folder contains two subfolders based on what method you use with snscrape such as using the CLI commands or the Python wrapper available with snscrape. Each sub-folder contains a Jupyter notebook and Python script that follows the code snippets in my article.

The contents of this folder and its subfolders are shown below.

* cli-with-python
  * snscrape-python-cli.ipynb
  * snscrape-python-cli.py
